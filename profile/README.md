## Welcome to the Team Oduist software!

As passionate creators, we develop and share our products under the Business Source License (BSL),
making them **freely available for download** from our GitHub repositories.

After the change date, our products will transition to the LGPLv3 license, ensuring long-term openness while maintaining a sustainable development model.

Our Business Source License (BSL) allows free commercial use of our products.
You can modify the code for your own business needs, but publishing or distributing these modifications is not permitted.

**If you wish to resell our modules, you'll need to purchase a commercial license.**

**Odoo Partners who want to include our products in their service offerings must obtain a partner agreement for redistribution rights.** 

To ensure continuous development, maintenance, and reliable use of our software, our applications and modules are available in two versions:
**Community Edition and Business Edition**. Additionally, some modules are available only for Business Edition users,
offering specialized tools and integrations that enhance productivity, security, and performance.

By choosing Business Edition, you gain access to our full suite of solutions, ensuring a stable, secure,
and continuously evolving platform while supporting the ongoing development of our software.
